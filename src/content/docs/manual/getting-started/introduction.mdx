[Three.js](https://threejs.org) is a 3D library that tries to make it as easy
as possible to get 3D content on a webpage.

Three.js uses either WebGL or WebGPU to draw 3D. [WebGL is a very low-level
system that only draws points, lines, and
triangles](https://webglfundamentals.org). To do anything useful with WebGL
generally requires quite a bit of code and that is where three.js comes in. It
handles stuff like scenes, lights, shadows, materials, textures, 3d math, all
things that you'd have to write yourself if you were to use WebGL directly.

## Prerequisites

Three.js is a javascript library so you'll need to know how to program
JavaScript. Some options for learning javascript include:
[mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting),
[codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript),
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/),
[web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/javascript) and many more. You don't need to be
an expert to get started. Learning a little html and css will help too.

## Setup

In order to do three.js development you'll need to use a web server.
[Vite](https://vite.dev/) is the recommended tool for web development but
you're welcome to use your tools of choice.

### node

## Option 1: Install with NPM and a build tool

### Development

Installing from the [ npm package registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) and using a
[ build tool](https://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html#h_zWTXAU93DC) is
the recommended approach for most users — the more dependencies your project
needs, the more likely you are to run into problems that the static hosting
cannot easily resolve. With a build tool, importing local JavaScript files and
npm packages should work out of the box, without import maps.

<ol>
<li>
Install [ Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). We'll need it to load manage dependencies and to run our build tool.
</li>
<li>

Install three.js and a build tool, [ Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), using a [
terminal](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/terminal-for-js-devs/) in your
project folder. Vite will be used during development, but it isn't part of the
final webpage. If you prefer to use another build tool, that's fine — we
support modern build tools that can import [ ES
Modules](https://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html#h_zWTXAU93DC).

```javascript

# three.js
npm install --save three

# vite
npm install --save-dev vite

```

<details>
<summary>Installation added _node_modules/_ and _package.json_ to my project. What are they?</summary>

npm uses _package.json_ to describe which versions of each dependency you've
installed. If you have other people working on the project with you, they can
install the original versions of each dependency simply by running _npm
install_. If you're using version history, commit _package.json_.

npm installs the code for each dependency in a new _node_modules/_ folder. When
Vite builds your application, it sees imports for 'three' and pulls three.js
files automatically from this folder. The _node_modules/_ folder is used only
during development, and shouldn't be uploaded to your web hosting provider or
committed to version history.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Improve your editor auto-completion with _jsconfig_ or _tsconfig_</summary>

Place a _jsconfig.json_ (or _tsconfig.json_ for TypeScript projects) in your
project's root. Adding the configuration below helps your editor locate
three.js files for enhanced auto-completion.

```javascript

{
"compilerOptions": {
// other options...
"paths": {
"three/webgpu": ["node_modules/three/build/three.webgpu.js"],
"three/tsl": ["node_modules/three/build/three.tsl.js"],
},
}
}

```

</details>
</aside>
</li>
<li>
From your terminal, run:

```javascript

npx vite

```

<aside>
<details>
<summary>What is _npx_?</summary>

npx is installed with Node.js, and runs command line programs like Vite so that
you don't have to search for the right file in _node_modules/_ yourself. If you
prefer, you can put [ Vite's common
commands](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#command-line-interface) into the [
package.json:scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts) list,
and use _npm run dev_ instead.

</details>
</aside>
</li>
<li>
If everything went well, you'll see a URL like _http://localhost:5173_ appear in your terminal, and can open that URL to see your web application.
</li>
</ol>

The page will be blank — you're ready to [ create a
scene](/manual/introduction/Creating-a-scene).

    Server](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/local-server)

    basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Package_management)
  </li>
</ul>

### Production

Later, when you're ready to deploy your web application, you'll just need to
tell Vite to run a production build — _npx vite build_. Everything used by the
application will be compiled, optimized, and copied into the _dist/_ folder.
The contents of that folder are ready to be hosted on your website.

## Option 2: Import from a CDN

### Development

Installing without build tools will require some changes to the project
structure given above.

<ol>
<li>

We imported code from 'three' (an npm package) in _main.js_, and web browsers
don't know what that means. In _index.html_ we'll need to add an [ import
map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)
defining where to get the package. Put the code below inside the
_<head></head>_ tag, after the styles.

```javascript

<script type="importmap">
{
"imports": {
"three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@<version>/build/three.module.js",
"three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@<version>/examples/jsm/"
}
}
</script>

```

Don't forget to replace _`<version>`_ with an actual version of three.js, like
_"v0.149.0"_. The most recent version can be found on the [ npm version
list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three?activeTab=versions).

</li>
<li>

We'll also need to run a _local server_ to host these files at URL where the
web browser can access them. While it's technically possible to double-click an
HTML file and open it in your browser, important features that we'll later
implement, do not work when the page is opened this way, for security reasons.

Install [ Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), then run [
serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to start a local server in the
project's directory:

```javascript

npx serve .

```

</li>
<li>
If everything went well, you'll see a URL like http://localhost:3000 appear in your terminal, and can open that URL to see your web application.
</li>
</ol>

The page will be blank — you're ready to [ create a
scene](/manual/introduction/Creating-a-scene).

Many other local static servers are available — some use different languages
instead of Node.js, and others are desktop applications. They all work
basically the same way, and we've provided a few alternatives below.

<details>
<summary>More local servers</summary>

### Command Line

Command line local servers run from a terminal window. The associated
programming language may need to be installed first.

<ul>
  <li>_npx http-server_ (Node.js)</li>
  <li>_npx five-server_ (Node.js)</li>
  <li>_python -m SimpleHTTPServer_ (Python 2.x)</li>
  <li>_python -m http.server_ (Python 3.x)</li>
  <li>_php -S localhost:8000_ (PHP 5.4+)</li>
</ul>

### GUI

GUI local servers run as an application window on your computer, and may have a
user interface.

<ul>
  <li>[ Servez](https://greggman.github.io/servez)</li>
</ul>

### Code Editor Plugins

Some code editors have plugins that spawn a simple server on demand.

<ul>
  <li>
    [ Five
    Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server)
    for Visual Studio Code
  </li>
  <li>
    [ Live
    Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
    for Visual Studio Code
  </li>
  <li>[ Live Server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server) for Atom</li>
</ul>

</details>

### Production

When you're ready to deploy your web application, push the source files to your
web hosting provider — no need to build or compile anything. The downside of
that tradeoff is that you'll need to be careful to keep the import map updated
with any dependencies (and dependencies of dependencies!) that your application
requires. If the CDN hosting your dependencies goes down temporarily, your
website will stop working too.

_**IMPORTANT:** Import all dependencies from the same version of three.js, and
from the same CDN. Mixing files from different sources may cause duplicate code
to be included, or even break the application in unexpected ways._

## Addons

Out of the box, three.js includes the fundamentals of a 3D engine. Other
three.js components — such as controls, loaders, and post-processing effects —
are part of the [
addons/](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm) directory.
Addons do not need to be _installed_ separately, but do need to be _imported_
separately.

The example below shows how to import three.js with the
[OrbitControls](examples/controls/OrbitControls) and
[GLTFLoader](examples/loaders/GLTFLoader) addons. Where necessary, this will
also be mentioned in each addon's documentation or examples.

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
import { OrbitControls } from "three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js";
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";

const controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
const loader = new GLTFLoader();
```

Some excellent third-party projects are available for three.js, too. These need
to be installed separately — see [ Libraries and
Plugins](/manual/introduction/Libraries-and-Plugins).
