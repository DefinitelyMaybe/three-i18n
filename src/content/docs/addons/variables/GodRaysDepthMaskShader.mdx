God-rays (crepuscular rays)

Similar implementation to the one used by Crytek for CryEngine 2 [Sousa2008].
Blurs a mask generated from the depth map along radial lines emanating from the light
source. The blur repeatedly applies a blur filter of increasing support but constant
sample count to produce a blur filter with large support.

My implementation performs 3 passes, similar to the implementation from Sousa. I found
just 6 samples per pass produced acceptable results. The blur is applied three times,
with decreasing filter support. The result is equivalent to a single pass with
6*6*6 = 216 samples.
