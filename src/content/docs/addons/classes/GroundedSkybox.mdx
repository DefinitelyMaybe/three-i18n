Defined in: three/addons/objects/GroundedSkybox.js:19

A ground-projected skybox.

By default the object is centered at the camera, so it is often helpful to set
`skybox.position.y = height` to put the ground at the origin.

```js
const height = 15, radius = 100;

const skybox = new GroundedSkybox( envMap, height, radius );
skybox.position.y = height;
scene.add( skybox );
```
