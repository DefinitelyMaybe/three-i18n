Defined in: three/addons/math/Octree.js:77

An octree is a hierarchical tree data structure used to partition a three-dimensional
space by recursively subdividing it into eight octants.

This particular implementation can have up to sixteen levels and stores up to eight triangles
in leaf nodes.

`Octree` can be used in games to compute collision between the game world and colliders from
the player or other dynamic 3D objects.

```js
const octree = new Octree().fromGraphNode( scene );
const result = octree.capsuleIntersect( playerCollider ); // collision detection
```
