Defined in: three/addons/curves/NURBSSurface.js:9

This class represents a NURBS surface.

Implementation is based on `(x, y [, z=0 [, w=1]])` control points with `w=weight`.

## Constructors

### Constructor

> **new NURBSSurface**(`degree1`, `degree2`, `knots1`, `knots2`, `controlPoints`): `NURBSSurface`

Defined in: three/addons/curves/NURBSSurface.js:19

Constructs a new NURBS surface.

#### Parameters

##### degree1

`number`

The first NURBS degree.

##### degree2

`number`

The second NURBS degree.

##### knots1

`number`[]

The first knots as a flat array of numbers.

##### knots2

`number`[]

The second knots as a flat array of numbers.

##### controlPoints

`any`[][]

An array^2 holding control points.

#### Returns

`NURBSSurface`

## Properties

### controlPoints

> **controlPoints**: `any`[][]

Defined in: three/addons/curves/NURBSSurface.js:53

An array holding arrays of control points.

***

### degree1

> **degree1**: `number`

Defined in: three/addons/curves/NURBSSurface.js:25

The first NURBS degree.

***

### degree2

> **degree2**: `number`

The second knots as a flat array of numbers.

## Methods

### getPoint()

> **getPoint**(`t1`, `t2`, `target`): `void`

Defined in: three/addons/curves/NURBSSurface.js:81

This method returns a vector in 3D space for the given interpolation factor. This vector lies on the NURBS surface.

#### Parameters

##### t1

`number`

The first interpolation factor representing the `u` position on the surface. Must be in the range `[0,1]`.

##### t2

`number`

The second interpolation factor representing the `v` position on the surface. Must be in the range `[0,1]`.

##### target

`Vector3`

The target vector the result is written to.

#### Returns

`void`
