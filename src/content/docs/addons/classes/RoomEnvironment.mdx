Defined in: three/addons/environments/RoomEnvironment.js:30

This class represents a scene with a basic room setup that can be used as
input for PMREMGenerator#fromScene. The resulting PMREM represents the room's
lighting and can be used for Image Based Lighting by assigning it to Scene#environment
or directly as an environment map to PBR materials.

The implementation is based on the [EnvironmentScene](https://github.com/google/model-viewer/blob/master/packages/model-viewer/src/three-components/EnvironmentScene.ts)
component from the `model-viewer` project.

```js
const environment = new RoomEnvironment();
const pmremGenerator = new THREE.PMREMGenerator( renderer );

const envMap = pmremGenerator.fromScene( environment ).texture;
scene.environment = envMap;
```
