## What is a color space?

Every color space is a collection of several design decisions, chosen together to support a
large range of colors while satisfying technical constraints related to precision and display
technologies. When creating a 3D asset, or assembling 3D assets together into a scene, it is
important to know what these properties are, and how the properties of one color space relate
to other color spaces in the scene.

<ul>
  <li>
    **Color primaries:** Primary colors (e.g. red, green, blue) are not
    absolutes; they are selected from the visible spectrum based on constraints
    of limited precision and capabilities of available display devices. Colors
    are expressed as a ratio of the primary colors.
  </li>
  <li>
    **White point:** Most color spaces are engineered such that an equally
    weighted sum of primaries _R = G = B_ will appear to be without color, or
    "achromatic". The appearance of achromatic values (like white or grey)
    depend on human perception, which in turn depends heavily on the context of
    the observer. A color space specifies its "white point" to balance these
    needs. The white point defined by the sRGB color space is [
    D65](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminant_D65).
  </li>
  <li>
    **Transfer functions:** After choosing the color gamut and a color model, we
    still need to define mappings ("transfer functions") of numerical values
    to/from the color space. Does _r = 0.5_ represent 50% less physical
    illumination than _r = 1.0_? Or 50% less bright, as perceived by an average
    human eye? These are different things, and that difference can be
    represented as a mathematical function. Transfer functions may be _linear_
    or _nonlinear_, depending on the objectives of the color space. sRGB defines
    nonlinear transfer functions. Those functions are sometimes approximated as
    _gamma functions_, but the term "gamma" is ambiguous and should be avoided
    in this context.
  </li>
</ul>

These three parameters — color primaries, white point, and transfer functions — define a color
space, with each chosen for particular goals. Having defined the parameters, a few additional terms
are helpful:

<ul>
  <li>
    **Color model:** Syntax for numerically identifying colors within chosen the
    color gamut — a coordinate system for colors. In three.js we're mainly
    concerned with the RGB color model, having three coordinates _r, g, b ∈
    [0,1]_ ("closed domain") or _r, g, b ∈ [0,∞]_ ("open domain") each
    representing a fraction of a primary color. Other color models (HSL, Lab,
    LCH) are commonly used for artistic control.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Color gamut:** Once color primaries and a white point have been chosen,
    these represent a volume within the visible spectrum (a "gamut"). Colors not
    within this volume ("out of gamut") cannot be expressed by closed domain
    [0,1] RGB values. In the open domain [0,∞], the gamut is technically
    infinite.
  </li>
</ul>

Consider two very common color spaces: [SRGBColorSpace](PAGE_URL_ERROR) ("sRGB") and
[LinearSRGBColorSpace](PAGE_URL_ERROR) ("Linear-sRGB"). Both use the same primaries and white point,
and therefore have the same color gamut. Both use the RGB color model. They differ only in
the transfer functions — Linear-sRGB is linear with respect to physical light intensity.
sRGB uses the nonlinear sRGB transfer functions, and more closely resembles the way that
the human eye perceives light and the responsiveness of common display devices.

That difference is important. Lighting calculations and other rendering operations must
generally occur in a linear color space. However, a linear colors are less efficient to
store in an image or framebuffer, and do not look correct when viewed by a human observer.
As a result, input textures and the final rendered image will generally use the nonlinear
sRGB color space.

<blockquote>

ℹ️ _**NOTICE:** While some modern displays support wider gamuts like Display-P3,
the web platform's graphics APIs largely rely on sRGB. Applications using three.js
today will typically use only the sRGB and Linear-sRGB color spaces._

</blockquote>

## Roles of color spaces

Linear workflows — required for modern rendering methods — generally involve more than
one color space, each assigned to a particular role. Linear and nonlinear color spaces are
appropriate for different roles, explained below.

### Input color space

Colors supplied to three.js — from color pickers, textures, 3D models, and other sources —
each have an associated color space. Those not already in the Linear-sRGB working color
space must be converted, and textures be given the correct _texture.colorSpace_ assignment.
Certain conversions (for hexadecimal and CSS colors in sRGB) can be made automatically if
the THREE.ColorManagement API is enabled before initializing colors:

```javascript
THREE.ColorManagement.enabled = true;
```

THREE.ColorManagement is enabled by default.

<ul>
  <li>
    **Materials, lights, and shaders:** Colors in materials, lights, and shaders
    store RGB components in the Linear-sRGB working color space.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Vertex colors:** [BufferAttributes](api/core/BufferAttribute) store RGB
    components in the Linear-sRGB working color space.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Color textures:** PNG or JPEG [Textures](api/textures/Texture) containing
    color information (like .map or .emissiveMap) use the closed domain sRGB
    color space, and must be annotated with _texture.colorSpace =
    SRGBColorSpace_. Formats like OpenEXR (sometimes used for .envMap or
    .lightMap) use the Linear-sRGB color space indicated with
    _texture.colorSpace = LinearSRGBColorSpace_, and may contain values in the
    open domain [0,∞].
  </li>
  <li>
    **Non-color textures:** Textures that do not store color information (like
    .normalMap or .roughnessMap) do not have an associated color space, and
    generally use the (default) texture annotation of _texture.colorSpace =
    NoColorSpace_. In rare cases, non-color data may be represented with other
    nonlinear encodings for technical reasons.
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

⚠️ _**WARNING:** Many formats for 3D models do not correctly or consistently
define color space information. While three.js attempts to handle most cases, problems
are common with older file formats. For best results, use glTF 2.0 ([GLTFLoader](examples/loaders/GLTFLoader))
and test 3D models in online viewers early to confirm the asset itself is correct._

</blockquote>

### Working color space

Rendering, interpolation, and many other operations must be performed in an open domain
linear working color space, in which RGB components are proportional to physical
illumination. In three.js, the working color space is Linear-sRGB.

### Output color space

Output to a display device, image, or video may involve conversion from the open domain
Linear-sRGB working color space to another color space. The conversion is defined by
([WebGLRenderer](api/renderers/WebGLRenderer#outputColorSpace)). When using post-processing, this requires OutputPass.

<ul>
  <li>
    **Display:** Colors written to a WebGL canvas for display should be in the
    sRGB color space.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Image:** Colors written to an image should use the color space appropriate
    for the format and usage. Fully-rendered images written to PNG or JPEG
    textures generally use the sRGB color space. Images containing emission,
    light maps, or other data not confined to the [0,1] range will generally use
    the open domain Linear-sRGB color space, and a compatible image format like
    OpenEXR.
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

⚠️ _**WARNING:** Render targets may use either sRGB or Linear-sRGB. sRGB makes
better use of limited precision. In the closed domain, 8 bits often suffice for sRGB
whereas ≥12 bits (half float) may be required for Linear-sRGB. If later pipeline
stages require Linear-sRGB input, the additional conversions may have a small
performance cost._

</blockquote>

Custom materials based on [ShaderMaterial](api/materials/ShaderMaterial) and [RawShaderMaterial](api/materials/RawShaderMaterial) have to implement their own output color space conversion.
For instances of `ShaderMaterial`, adding the `colorspace_fragment` shader chunk to the fragment shader's `main()` function should be sufficient.

## Working with THREE.Color instances

Methods reading or modifying [Color](api/math/Color) instances assume data is already in the
three.js working color space, Linear-sRGB. RGB and HSL components are direct
representations of data stored by the Color instance, and are never converted
implicitly. Color data may be explicitly converted with _.convertLinearToSRGB()_
or _.convertSRGBToLinear()_.

```javascript
// RGB components (no change).
color.r = color.g = color.b = 0.5;
console.log(color.r); // → 0.5

// Manual conversion.
color.r = 0.5;
color.convertSRGBToLinear();
console.log(color.r); // → 0.214041140
```

With _ColorManagement.enabled = true_ set (recommended), certain conversions
are made automatically. Because hexadecimal and CSS colors are generally sRGB, [Color](api/math/Color)
methods will automatically convert these inputs from sRGB to Linear-sRGB in setters, or
convert from Linear-sRGB to sRGB when returning hexadecimal or CSS output from getters.

```javascript
// Hexadecimal conversion.
color.setHex(0x808080);
console.log(color.r); // → 0.214041140
console.log(color.getHex()); // → 0x808080

// CSS conversion.
color.setStyle("rgb( 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 )");
console.log(color.r); // → 0.214041140

// Override conversion with 'colorSpace' argument.
color.setHex(0x808080, LinearSRGBColorSpace);
console.log(color.r); // → 0.5
console.log(color.getHex(LinearSRGBColorSpace)); // → 0x808080
console.log(color.getHex(SRGBColorSpace)); // → 0xBCBCBC
```

## Common mistakes

When an individual color or texture is misconfigured, it will appear darker or lighter than
expected. When the renderer's output color space is misconfigured, the entire scene may appear
darker (e.g. missing conversion to sRGB) or lighter (e.g. a double conversion to sRGB with
post-processing). In each case the problem may not be uniform, and simply increasing/decreasing
lighting does not solve it.

A more subtle issue appears when _both_ the input color spaces and the output color
spaces are incorrect — the overall brightness levels may be fine, but colors may change
unexpectedly under different lighting, or shading may appear more blown-out and less soft
than intended. These two wrongs do not make a right, and it's important that the working
color space be linear ("scene referred") and the output color space be nonlinear
("display referred").
