3D models are available in hundreds of file formats, each with different
purposes, assorted features, and varying complexity. Although
[
three.js provides many loaders](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm/loaders), choosing the right format and
workflow will save time and frustration later on. Some formats are
difficult to work with, inefficient for realtime experiences, or simply not
fully supported at this time.

This guide provides a workflow recommended for most users, and suggestions
for what to try if things don't go as expected.

## Before we start

If you're new to running a local server, begin with
[ installation](/manual/introduction/Installation)
first. Many common errors viewing 3D models can be avoided by hosting files
correctly.

## Recommended workflow

Where possible, we recommend using glTF (GL Transmission Format). Both

<small>.GLB</small> and <small>.GLTF</small> versions of the format are well
supported. Because glTF is focused on runtime asset delivery, it is compact to
transmit and fast to load. Features include meshes, materials, textures, skins,
skeletons, morph targets, animations, lights, and cameras.

Public-domain glTF files are available on sites like
[
Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount&type=models), or various tools include glTF export:

  <li>

    Graphics Inc
  </li>
  <li>
    &hellip;and [many more](http://github.khronos.org/glTF-Project-Explorer/)
  </li>
</ul>

If your preferred tools do not support glTF, consider requesting glTF
export from the authors, or posting on
[the glTF roadmap thread](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/1051).

When glTF is not an option, popular formats such as FBX, OBJ, or COLLADA
are also available and regularly maintained.

## Loading

Only a few loaders (e.g. [ObjectLoader](api/loaders/ObjectLoader)) are included by default with
three.js â€” others should be added to your app individually.

```javascript
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";
```

Once you've imported a loader, you're ready to add a model to your scene. Syntax varies among
different loaders â€” when using another format, check the examples and documentation for that
loader. For glTF, usage with global scripts would be:

```javascript
const loader = new GLTFLoader();

loader.load(
  "path/to/model.glb",
  function (gltf) {
    scene.add(gltf.scene);
  },
  undefined,
  function (error) {
    console.error(error);
  },
);
```

See [GLTFLoader documentation](examples/loaders/GLTFLoader) for further details.

## Troubleshooting

You've spent hours modeling an artisanal masterpiece, you load it into
the webpage, and â€” oh no! ðŸ˜­ It's distorted, miscolored, or missing entirely.
Start with these troubleshooting steps:

<ol>
  <li>
    Check the JavaScript console for errors, and make sure you've used an
    `onError` callback when calling `.load()` to log the result.
  </li>
  <li>
    View the model in another application. For glTF, drag-and-drop viewers are
    available for [three.js](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/) and
    [babylon.js](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/). If the model appears correctly
    in one or more applications, [file a bug against
    three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/new). If the model
    cannot be shown in any application, we strongly encourage filing a bug with
    the application used to create the model.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try scaling the model up or down by a factor of 1000. Many models are scaled
    differently, and large models may not appear if the camera is inside the
    model.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try to add and position a light source. The model may be hidden in the dark.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look for failed texture requests in the network tab, like
    `"C:\\Path\To\Model\texture.jpg"`. Use paths relative to your model instead,
    such as `images/texture.jpg` â€” this may require editing the model file in a
    text editor.
  </li>
</ol>

## Asking for help

If you've gone through the troubleshooting process above and your model
still isn't working, the right approach to asking for help will get you to
a solution faster. Post a question on the
[three.js forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/) and, whenever possible,
include your model (or a simpler model with the same problem) in any formats
you have available. Include enough information for someone else to reproduce
the issue quickly â€” ideally, a live demo.
