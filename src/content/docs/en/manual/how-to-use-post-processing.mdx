Many three.js applications render their 3D objects directly to the screen. Sometimes, however, you want to apply one or more graphical
effects like Depth-Of-Field, Bloom, Film Grain or various types of Anti-aliasing. Post-processing is a widely used approach
to implement such effects. First, the scene is rendered to a render target which represents a buffer in the video card's memory.
In the next step one or more post-processing passes apply filters and effects to the image buffer before it is eventually rendered to
the screen.

three.js provides a complete post-processing solution via `EffectComposer` to implement such a workflow.

## Workflow

The first step in the process is to import all necessary files from the examples directory. The guide assumes you are using the official
[ npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three) of three.js. For our basic demo in this guide we need the following files.

```js
import { EffectComposer } from "three/addons/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js";
import { RenderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/RenderPass.js";
import { GlitchPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/GlitchPass.js";
import { OutputPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/OutputPass.js";
```

After all files are successfully imported, we can create our composer by passing in an instance of `WebGLRenderer`.

```js
const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer);
```

When using a composer, it's necessary to change the application's animation loop. Instead of calling the render method of
`WebGLRenderer`, we now use the respective counterpart of `EffectComposer`.

```js
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);

  composer.render();
}
```

Our composer is now ready so it's possible to configure the chain of post-processing passes. These passes are responsible for creating
the final visual output of the application. They are processed in order of their addition/insertion. In our example, the instance of `RenderPass`
is executed first, then the instance of `GlitchPass` and finally `OutputPass`. The last enabled pass in the chain is automatically rendered to the screen.
The setup of the passes looks like so:

```js
const renderPass = new RenderPass(scene, camera);
composer.addPass(renderPass);

const glitchPass = new GlitchPass();
composer.addPass(glitchPass);

const outputPass = new OutputPass();
composer.addPass(outputPass);
```

`RenderPass` is normally placed at the beginning of the chain in order to provide the rendered scene as an input for the next post-processing step. In our case,
`GlitchPass` is going to use these image data to apply a wild glitch effect. `OutputPass` is usually the last pass in the chain which performs sRGB color space conversion and tone mapping.
Check out this [ live example](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_postprocessing_glitch) to see it in action.

## Built-in Passes

You can use a wide range of pre-defined post-processing passes provided by the engine. They are located in the
[ postprocessing](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm/postprocessing) directory.

## Custom Passes

Sometimes you want to write a custom post-processing shader and include it into the chain of post-processing passes. For this scenario,
you can utilize `ShaderPass`. After importing the file and your custom shader, you can use the following code to setup the pass.

```js
import { ShaderPass } from "three/addons/postprocessing/ShaderPass.js";
import { LuminosityShader } from "three/addons/shaders/LuminosityShader.js";

// later in your init routine

const luminosityPass = new ShaderPass(LuminosityShader);
composer.addPass(luminosityPass);
```

The repository provides a file called [ CopyShader](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/jsm/shaders/CopyShader.js) which is a
good starting code for your own custom shader. `CopyShader` just copies the image contents of the `EffectComposer`'s read buffer
to its write buffer without applying any effects.
