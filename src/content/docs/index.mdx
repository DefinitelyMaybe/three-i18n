import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Remixed how?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Starlight" icon="pencil">
    Built with Astro Starlight ‚≠ê All pages are markdown files; bit nicer than
    working with html directly üòâ
  </Card>
  <Card title="W.I.P" icon="warning">
    Work in progress. Things are not complete and will change without notice.
  </Card>
</CardGrid
