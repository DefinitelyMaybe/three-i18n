***

### attributes

> **attributes**: `object`

Defined in: three/src/core/BufferGeometry.js:121

This dictionary has as id the name of the attribute to be set and as value
the buffer attribute to set it to. Rather than accessing this property directly,
use `setAttribute()` and `getAttribute()` to access attributes of this geometry.

#### Inherited from

[`BufferGeometry`](Three.BufferGeometry.html).[`attributes`](Three.BufferGeometry.html#attributes)

***

### boundingBox

> **boundingBox**: [`Box3`](Three.Box3.html)

Defined in: three/src/core/BufferGeometry.js:162

Bounding box for the geometry which can be calculated with `computeBoundingBox()`.

#### Default

```ts
null
```

#### Inherited from

[`BufferGeometry`](Three.BufferGeometry.html).[`boundingBox`](Three.BufferGeometry.html#boundingbox)

***

### boundingSphere

> **boundingSphere**: [`Sphere`](Three.Sphere.html)

Defined in: three/src/core/BufferGeometry.js:170

Bounding sphere for the geometry which can be calculated with `computeBoundingSphere()`.

#### Default

```ts
null
```

***

### drawRange

> **drawRange**: `object`

Defined in: three/src/core/BufferGeometry.js:178

Determines the part of the geometry to render. This should not be set directly,
instead use `setDrawRange()`.

#### count

> **count**: `number`

#### start

> **start**: `number`

#### Inherited from

[`BufferGeometry`](Three.BufferGeometry.html).[`drawRange`](Three.BufferGeometry.html#drawrange)

***

### groups

> **groups**: `any`[]

Defined in: three/src/core/BufferGeometry.js:154

Split the geometry into groups, each of which will be rendered in a
separate draw call. This allows an array of materials to be used with the geometry.

Use `addGroup()` and `clearGroups()` to edit groups, rather than modifying this array directly.

Every vertex and index must belong to exactly one group â€” groups must not share vertices or
indices, and must not leave vertices or indices unused.

#### Inherited from

[`BufferGeometry`](Three.BufferGeometry.html).[`groups`](Three.BufferGeometry.html#groups)

***

### index

> **index**: [`BufferAttribute`](Three.BufferAttribute.html)

Defined in: three/src/core/BufferGeometry.js:101

Allows for vertices to be re-used across multiple triangles; this is
called using "indexed triangles". Each triangle is associated with the
indices of three vertices. This attribute therefore stores the index of
each vertex for each triangular face. If this attribute is not set, the
renderer assumes that each three contiguous positions represent a single triangle.

#### Default

```ts
null
```

#### Inherited from

[`BufferGeometry`](Three.BufferGeometry.html).[`index`](Three.BufferGeometry.html#index)

***

### indirect

> **indirect**: [`BufferAttribute`](Three.BufferAttribute.html)

Defined in: three/src/core/BufferGeometry.js:112

be changed. You will have to call `dispose()?, and create a new geometry instance.

#### Inherited from

***

### morphTargetsRelative

> **morphTargetsRelative**: `boolean`

target data is treated as relative offsets, rather than as absolute
positions/normals.

#### Default
