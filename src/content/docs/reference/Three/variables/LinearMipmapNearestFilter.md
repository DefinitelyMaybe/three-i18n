> `const` **LinearMipmapNearestFilter**: `number` = `1007`

Defined in: [three/src/constants.js:614](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/three-i18n/blob/fa57b79433d1c349ffb23a78727299c8d4190136/three/src/constants.js#L614)

Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the pixel being textured and uses
the `LinearFilter` criterion (a weighted average of the four texels that are closest to the
center of the pixel) to produce a texture value.
