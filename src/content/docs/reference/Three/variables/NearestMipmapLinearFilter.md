> `const` **NearestMipmapLinearFilter**: `number` = `1005`

Defined in: [three/src/constants.js:593](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/three-i18n/blob/fa57b79433d1c349ffb23a78727299c8d4190136/three/src/constants.js#L593)

Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel being textured and
uses the `NearestFilter` criterion to produce a texture value from each mipmap.
The final texture value is a weighted average of those two values.

## Constant
