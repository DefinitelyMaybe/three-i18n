> `const` **LinearMipmapLinearFilter**: `number` = `1008`

Defined in: [three/src/constants.js:625](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/three-i18n/blob/fa57b79433d1c349ffb23a78727299c8d4190136/three/src/constants.js#L625)

Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the pixel being textured and uses
the `LinearFilter` criterion to produce a texture value from each mipmap. The final texture value
is a weighted average of those two values.
