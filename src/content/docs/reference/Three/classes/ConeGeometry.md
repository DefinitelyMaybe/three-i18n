Split the geometry into groups, each of which will be rendered in a
separate draw call. This allows an array of materials to be used with the geometry.

Use `addGroup()` and `clearGroups()` to edit groups, rather than modifying this array directly.

Every vertex and index must belong to exactly one group â€” groups must not share vertices or
indices, and must not leave vertices or indices unused.

Allows for vertices to be re-used across multiple triangles; this is
called using "indexed triangles". Each triangle is associated with the
indices of three vertices. This attribute therefore stores the index of
each vertex for each triangular face. If this attribute is not set, the
renderer assumes that each three contiguous positions represent a single triangle.

Computes vertex normals for the given vertex data. For indexed geometries, the method sets
each vertex normal to be the average of the face normals of the faces that share that vertex.
