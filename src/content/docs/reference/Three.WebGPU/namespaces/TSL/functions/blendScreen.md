Defined in: [three/src/nodes/display/BlendModes.js:69](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/three-i18n/blob/fa57b79433d1c349ffb23a78727299c8d4190136/three/src/nodes/display/BlendModes.js#L69)

Represents a "Screen" blend mode.

Similar to `blendDodge()`, this mode also lightens the base layer's colors based on the color of the blend layer.
The "Screen" blend mode is better for general brightening whereas the "Dodge" results in more subtle and nuanced
effects.
